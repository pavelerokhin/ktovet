# Ktovet

## Overview
Ktovet is a high-level interpreter designed for the DSL (Domain Specific Language) and acts as a wrapper around Selenium for headless crawling. It provides a convenient and efficient way to automate web crawling tasks while leveraging the power of Selenium's web automation capabilities.

This repository serves as the home for the Ktovet project, providing all the necessary code and resources for utilizing the interpreter and integrating it into your own projects.

##Features
- DSL Interpreter: Ktovet includes a high-level interpreter for executing DSL commands. The 
interpreter understands the DSL syntax and translates it into corresponding actions performed by Selenium.
- Headless Crawling: Ktovet utilizes Selenium's headless browsing capabilities, allowing you to 
  crawl websites without launching a visible browser window.
- Efficient Automation: With Ktovet, you can automate various web crawling tasks, such as form 
  filling, button clicking, page navigation, data extraction, and more, using simple and expressive DSL commands.
- Selenium Integration: Ktovet acts as a convenient wrapper around Selenium, providing a 
  higher-level abstraction for interacting with web pages and reducing the complexity of writing Selenium-specific code.

## Getting Started
To get started with Ktovet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the Ktovet repository to your local machine using the following 
command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavelerokhin/ktovet.git
```
2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies 
using a package manager of your choice. For example, if you're using pip, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Write Your DSL Script: Create a new DSL script or modify the existing ones to suit your web 
crawling needs. The DSL provides a set of commands that Ktovet can interpret and execute.

4. Run the Interpreter: Execute your DSL script using the Ktovet interpreter. For example:

```bash
python interpreter.py my_script.dsl
```
This command will run the Ktovet interpreter and execute the commands specified in the 
`my_script.ktovet` file.

5. Enjoy the Results: Sit back and let Ktovet automate the web crawling tasks for you. The 
interpreter will execute the DSL commands using Selenium and provide you with the desired output or results.

For more detailed information and usage examples, refer to the documentation available in the repository.
